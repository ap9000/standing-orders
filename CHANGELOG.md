# Changelog

## 0.5.0 — 2026-09-25

Flows: your process drawn as zones that cards move through, with agents doing
the work and people deciding.

- **Canvas and chat.** Draw flows on a canvas or describe them to the lead;
  every change is a card you confirm. Templates for coding, research, issue
  triage, spam filtering, lead, effort and exception routing, and email replies.
- **Triggers.** Buttons (and public forms), schedules, GitHub, Linear, other
  flows and webhooks start cards on their own.
- **People.** Owners, followers, @mentions, and a flow owner whom decisions
  go to, in their chat app.
- **Steps with and without AI.** Build and Research tasks; scripts with no AI;
  **Sort** with Jev (TypeSafe's decision model, through OpenRouter); **Draft**
  with Claude; web requests with secrets kept to headers; email through your
  own mail server; any of a project's MCP tools; updates to the GitHub or
  Linear issue a card came from.
- **Decisions from your phone.** Telegram, Slack, Discord and Teams
  messages carry the draft with Approve, Edit and Send back.
- **Live canvas.** A flow open in several browsers changes in all of them
  the moment a card moves, and shows who else has it open and which card
  they're looking at.
- **Insights.** Where each flow breaks, how scripts do, how well sorting
  sorts, and every step's log.
- **Linux.** A one-command installer, and Claude and Gemini agents fenced
  with bubblewrap the way Seatbelt fences them on macOS.
- **First look.** `demo` now includes two flows mid-flight, and an empty
  Flows page offers a working example.
- **Settings.** An Email section, and "Check again" that really tests an
  API key.

Schema 88: the database upgrades itself on first start.
