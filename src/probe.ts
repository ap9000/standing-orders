/**
 * Asking an environment whether it has what the work needs.
 *
 * A probe is an operator-authored command line whose exit 0 means "present
 * and alive": `gh auth status`, `test -n "$SUPABASE_KEY"`. It runs through
 * a real shell, deliberately — the design's own examples need expansion and
 * `test` — and that is safe only because of who wrote it: probes are stored
 * by the operator, at `cap add`, with the author recorded. Nothing an agent
 * or a scanned repository writes is ever executed as a probe; the scanner
 * synthesizes probes from a fixed template over validated identifiers or
 * stores none at all.
 *
 * The answer is a claim about one machine at one moment. `verified` carries
 * when and by whom; anything else carries the probe's own words — "exit 1",
 * "timed out", "sh not found" — because collapsing those to a bit discards
 * exactly what tells an operator whether to paste a key or fix a PATH.
