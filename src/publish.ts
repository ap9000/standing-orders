/**
 * Publication (§M4): built work becomes a pushed branch and a pull request,
 * under a grant whose every term was shown before the yes, through a durable
 * intent that survives any crash between "done" and "opened".
 *
 * Two external writes, two named capabilities. Pushing a branch and opening
 * a PR hurt differently, so `push-branch` and `open-pr` are granted
 * separately, with the exact GitHub repository, remote, allowed head
 * prefix, and base branch fixed at grant time — the worker re-proves all of
 * them at publish time, because a grant revoked overnight must stop the
 * morning's pushes.
 *
 * The push names the exact SHA the fenced completion accepted —
 * `git push <remote> <sha>:refs/heads/<head>` — never "whatever the branch
 * points at now". The PR is adopt-or-create: the worker first asks GitHub
 * for an open PR on that head and adopts it, so a crash after `pr create`
 * and before the record lands cannot mint a twin. The body is generated
 * only from durable state (task, scope, run record, answered decisions),
 * with the agent's prose fenced in a quote block so `Fixes #…` or an
 * @-mention in its conclusion cannot acquire GitHub semantics.
