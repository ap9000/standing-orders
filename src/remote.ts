/**
 * The half of "in flight" that is not on this machine.
 *
 * Branches come off the local filesystem in milliseconds. Pull requests and
 * issues are a network round trip per repository, and that difference is the
 * whole reason this is a separate module with a budget attached rather than
 * three more lines inside discovery.
 *
 * An earlier draft kept these behind their own command precisely because of
 * the cost, and the milestone still asks for one command that shows every
 * branch, pull request, and issue in flight. Both concerns are real, so this
 * follows the rule the rest of the tool already uses for expensive reads:
 * price it, bound it, and **say what you withheld**. Twenty-four repositories
 * on hotel wifi will not hang; they will come back with what fitted in the
 * budget and a line naming what did not.
 *
 * The budget is for the whole phase, not per repository. A per-call timeout
 * bounds the worst case at repos × timeout, which for a machine full of work
 * is not a bound anybody would recognise as one.
