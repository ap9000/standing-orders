/** The result page's acts (2026-10-02), chosen in one place: exactly one ink
 * act, the one that resolves the result's state, and never navigation; at
 * most one outline act beside it. A result that can't be accepted says why
 * in one line before them.
 *
 *   everything met                      → Accept and finish
 *   a "You check this one" unanswered   → the next check, then Accept without your check
 *   a check you marked Not right        → Request changes, then Accept anyway
 *   checks queued or running            → Checks running (disabled), then Accept without checks
 *   checks didn't run, a check exists   → Run checks, then Accept without checks
 *   report and changes disagree,
 *   or the proof is refuted             → Request changes, then Accept (as allowed);
 *                                         never Accept as ink, even with no form here
 *   a Needs you form resolves it        → that form (Build again, Confirm it stopped)
 *   saved notes or a failing PR         → Revise / Draft a repair task
 *   a failed build                      → Retry (its note starts with what to change), then Run checks when they
 *                                         didn't run; never Accept: a failed build is not a result to accept
 *   a failed task's delivered result    → Retry, then Accept anyway (in outline, with a reason) where it may be
 *                                         accepted; Run checks stays in its Checks row
 *
 * Accepting finishes the task in one request (Accept and finish): the person's
 * acceptance, when one is owed, and the completion together. This only decides
 * which act is ink; the page recomputes it as the person answers each check. */
