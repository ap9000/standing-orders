/**
 * OS process containment (docs/PROCESS_CONTAINMENT_PLAN.md).
 *
 * The stop contract before this module was OBSERVATIONAL: a provider's
 * tree is scanned every 500 ms, and a double fork can reparent between
 * scans. This module adds an OS boundary where the OS has one, and says
 * exactly what it has where it has none:
 *
 *   linux   a delegated cgroup v2 directory per spawn. The target is
 *           placed in it BEFORE it executes (the `sh` prelude below writes
 *           its own pid, then execs the target with argv verbatim), so a
 *           setsid/double-fork helper is born inside and dies with
 *           `cgroup.kill`. Emptiness is the kernel's own `cgroup.events`
 *           populated flag — never a transport exit. A detached janitor
 *           kills the cgroup when this worker dies.
 *   win32   a Job Object with kill-on-close and no breakaway, owned by a
 *           PowerShell helper OUTSIDE the job that creates the target
 *           suspended, assigns it, then resumes it. The helper's death —
 *           including this worker's death, which closes its stdin — closes
 *           the handle and the job kills everything in it.
 *   darwin  nothing. There is no supported cgroup/Job Object equivalent;
 *           NOTE_TRACK/NOTE_CHILD have been unsupported since 10.5 and
 *           launchd's AbandonProcessGroup only covers a process group. The
 *           observational mode stays, is reported as exactly that, and a
 *           REQUIRED policy refuses before any target executes.
 *
 * Three policies: `observed` (the behaviour every existing installation
 * has), `preferred` (native when this machine can, observed — and said
 * so — when it cannot), `required` (native or a refusal; never a silent
 * downgrade). The policy is decided ONCE per controller process from the
 * operator's flag or environment and pinned; nothing a child supplies and
 * no corrupt value can weaken a pinned requirement.
