/**
 * Permission to write to somebody else's tracker.
 *
 * Everything up to here reads. This is the line, and it is drawn deliberately
 * wide of where it needs to be: discovery indexes everything it can see, and
 * Standing Orders drives only what has been handed over, one repository and one
 * backend at a time, by a person, in an act that shows its own consequences
 * first.
 *
 * The grant is not a boolean. A yes/no flag would answer "may I write here"
 * and leave every interesting question — write *what*, to *which* tasks, with
 * *whose* credentials, visible to *whom* — to whatever the agent decided at
 * 3am. So the record carries all of them, and the check is against the whole
 * thing.
 *
 * Two defaults are load-bearing.
 *
 * **Only tasks we created or were given.** An operator enrolling a repository
 * with four hundred open issues is not volunteering all four hundred to an
 * unattended agent, and reading enrollment that way is how a tool ends up
 * closing somebody's backlog overnight.
 *
 * **Closing is not included.** Creating a task is additive and reversible;
 * transitioning one we own is ours to do; closing work somebody else filed is
 * neither, so it is off unless explicitly granted. Widening takes another
 * human action, which is the design's rule and not a nicety.
 *
 * Absence of a grant is denial. There is no implicit, inherited, or default
 * permission anywhere in this module — an unknown repository is refused for
 * the same reason an unknown lease is: silence is not consent.
