/**
 * OS boot identity for process custody (OS containment and login recovery).
 *
 * A process witness carries the PID it saw, the host that saw it, and —
 * from v53 — the identity of the OS boot it was born under. After a
 * VERIFIED boot change on the same host, no process of the old boot can
 * survive: a pending stop or recovery that would otherwise wait forever
 * on an incomplete old spawn, or on a PID the new boot has since reused,
 * may settle. Every other case keeps the conservative road the witness
 * already took: a witness with no boot id (legacy), a witness from
 * another host, a boot id this host cannot read or cannot parse, or two
 * identical ids (the same boot, where the PID probe still decides).
 *
 * The identity comes from the kernel's own per-boot token, never from
 * wall-clock arithmetic: a boot time compared to `now` proves nothing
 * across suspended clocks, NTP steps and time-zone edits.
 *
 *   linux   /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id — a UUID minted at boot
 *   darwin  sysctl kern.bootsessionuuid    — a UUID minted at boot
 *   win32   no unprivileged per-boot UUID this build trusts → unknown
