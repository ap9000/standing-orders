/**
 * Reading the state of repositories.
 *
 * Every git invocation here is a read, and every one is prefixed with
 * `--no-optional-locks` — Night Orders scans repositories the operator may be
 * working in right now, and a discovery pass must never contend for the index
 * lock with their editor.
 *
 * Nothing raises. A repository that cannot be read comes back as a snapshot
 * carrying a named problem, because the alternative is a scan of forty repos
 * ending on the one that is broken.
 *
 * The reads are deliberately unequal in cost, and that shapes the module.
 * Listing refs, worktrees and the remote is O(refs) and lands in tens of
 * milliseconds. Computing ahead/behind walks history per branch — measured at
 * 22s on a cold 304MB repo — so it is bounded and degrades to a branch list
 * without it. Reading the working tree is O(working tree), measured at over
 * two minutes, so it does not happen at all unless asked for.
