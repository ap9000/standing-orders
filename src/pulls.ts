/**
 * What is waiting on a person.
 *
 * A pull request is where agent work stops being reversible, so it is where the
 * operator's attention actually has to land. The question this module answers is
 * not "what pull requests exist" but "which of these is waiting on me, and for
 * how long has it been waiting" — the case that motivated it was two finished,
 * green, unflagged pull requests that sat open for two months because nothing
 * ever said so.
 *
 * Three rules shape the classification.
 *
 * Absence of a verdict is not a negative verdict. GitHub computes mergeability
 * lazily, so `UNKNOWN` means not yet computed and must never be reported as a
 * conflict. Likewise an empty check rollup means no checks are configured, not
 * that checks passed.
 *
 * A failure outranks work still in progress. If one check has failed while
 * others are queued, the failure is already actionable and saying "running"
 * would defer a decision that can be made now.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches the network or the filesystem except `readPulls`, so the
 * part worth testing needs no fixture repository and no GitHub account.
