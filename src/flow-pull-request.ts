/**
 * A flow's Pull request zone (flows.ts): the card's built result becomes a pull request under the project's pull
 * request setup — the same grant, publisher and merge as Complete → pull request (pull-request-flow.ts) — and CI
 * decides where the card goes: on when checks pass (merging first when the zone says so), down the failure path
 * when they fail, with the failing check named on the card. A failure path back to a Build zone becomes a revision
 * of that same work carrying the failure, as a person's send back does.
 *
 * A zone that merges only ever merges a card a person approved (a "Person decides" zone) after it was last built:
 * the flow can't be drawn otherwise (validateFlowDefinition), and a card moved in by hand or by a trigger is checked
 * here too. Without that approval the checks passing leave it waiting for a person.
 *
 * Model-free, in the worker's step pass. The publisher and CI observation run in the watch loop; this reads what
 * they recorded, and reads GitHub itself only to name a failing check and to merge.
